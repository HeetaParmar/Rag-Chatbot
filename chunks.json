These connections can be\nmaintained over a large geographical area, such as a city or an entire country, by use of multiple antenna\nsites or satellite systems maintained by wireless service providers.\nSome ThinkPad notebook computers come with a built-in wireless-WAN card integrated with some\nwireless-WAN technologies, such as 1xEV-DO, HSPA, 3G, GPRS, or LTE. By using the built-in wireless-WAN\ncard and the configuration utility that comes with your computer, you can establish wireless-WAN\nconnections and monitor the connection status.\nNote: The wireless-WAN service is provided by authorized service providers in some countries.\nTips for using the wireless-WAN feature\nTo achieve the best connection, use the following guidelines:\n\u2022 Keep your computer away from your body.\n\u2022 Place your computer on a flat surface and open your computer lid to an angle of slightly more than\n90 degrees.\n\u2022 Place your computer away from concrete or brick walls that might dampen cellular signals.\n\u2022 Best reception will be available near windows and other locations where cellular phone reception is the\nstrongest.\nChecking the wireless-WAN connection status\nYou can check the wireless-WAN connection status through the wireless-network-connection-status icon in\nthe Windows notification area. The more bars encompassed, the better the signal is.\nFor the Windows 7 operating system, you also can check the Access Connections gauge, the Access\nConnections status icon, or the Access Connections wireless status icon in the Windows notification area.\nAccess Connections gauge:\n\u2022\nNo signal\n\u2022\nWeak signal\n\u2022\nMedium signal\n\u2022\nStrong signal\nAccess Connections status icon:\n\u2022\nNo location profile is active or none exists.\n\u2022\nCurrent location profile is disconnected.\n\u2022\nCurrent location profile is connected.\nChapter 2.

Be sure to delete data stored on the hard disk\ndrive or solid-state drive before you dispose of, sell, or hand over your computer.\nYou can use the following methods to delete data from the hard disk drive or solid-state drive:\n\u2022 Move the data to the Recycle Bin, and then emptying the Recycle Bin.\n\u2022 Delete the data.\n\u2022 Format your hard disk drive or solid-state drive, using the software for initializing it.\n\u2022 Use the recovery program provided by Lenovo to bring the hard disk drive or solid-state drive back to\nthe factory default settings.\nThese operations, however, only change the file location of the data; they do not delete the data itself. In\nother words, the data retrieval processing is disabled under an operating system such as Windows. The\ndata is still there, even though it seems to be lost. Thus, it is sometimes possible to read the data by use of\nspecial software for data recovery. There is a risk that people of bad faith might read and misuse the critical\ndata on hard disk drives or solid-state drives for unexpected purposes.\nTo prevent leakage of data, it is important that you delete all the data from the hard disk drive when you\ndispose of, sell, or hand over your computer. You can destroy the data physically by smashing the hard disk\ndrive with a hammer, or magnetically by means of strong magnetic power, thus making the data unreadable.\nBut it is recommended that you use the software (payware) or service (pay service) developed for that\npurpose. The process might take several hours.\nFor disposing of data on the solid-state drive, Lenovo provides the Drive Erase Utility for Resetting the\nCryptographic Key and Erasing the Solid State Drive tool. For disposing of data on the hard disk drive, Lenovo\nprovides the Secure Data Disposal\u2122tool. Go to http://www.lenovo.com/support to download the tool.\nIf an Encryption solid-state drive or a Disk Encryption hard disk drive is supported and installed in your\ncomputer, you can logically dispose of all the data on the drive in a short time by erasing the cryptographic\nChapter 5.

The data encrypted with the old key is not physically erased but remains on the drive; however, it cannot\nbe decrypted without the old key. This feature is also available with the Drive Erase Utility for Resetting the\nCryptographic Key and Erasing the Solid State Drive tool.\nUsing firewalls\nIf your system is preinstalled with a firewall program, it protects against computer Internet security threats,\nunauthorized accesses, intrusions, and Internet attacks. It also protects your privacy.\nFor more information about how to use the firewall program, refer to the help information system that\ncomes with the program.\nProtecting data against viruses\nYour computer is preinstalled with an antivirus program so you can detect and eliminate viruses. The\nantivirus program is designed to help you detect and eliminate viruses.\nLenovo provides a full version of antivirus software on your computer with a free 30-day subscription. After\n30 days, you must renew the license to continue receiving the antivirus software updates.\nFor more information about how to use your antivirus software, refer to the help information system of\nyour antivirus software.\n68\nUser Guide\n", "Section Title: Chapter 6.

The M.2 solid-state drive is designed\nand developed for the \u201ccache\u201d function purpose only. If you use the M.2 solid-state drive as a bootable\ndevice, its reliability is not guaranteed.\n\u2022 Check the capacity of your hard disk drive from time to time. If the hard disk drive gets too full, the\nWindows operating system will slow down and might produce errors.\nTo check the hard disk drive capacity, do the following:\n\u2013 Windows 7: Click Start \u2799Computer.\n\u2013 Windows 8 and Windows 8.1: Open the File Explorer and click Computer.\n\u2013 Windows 10: Open the File Explorer and click This PC.\n\u2022 Empty your recycle bin on a regular basis.\n\u2022 Use disk defragment tool regularly on your hard disk drive to improve data seek and read times.\n\u2022 To free up disk space, uninstall unused programs.\nNote: You also might want to look for program duplication or overlapping versions.\n\u2022 Clean out your Inbox, Sent, and Trash folders from your e-mail client program.\n\u2022 Back up your data at least once a week. If critical data is present, it is a good idea to perform a daily\nbackup operation. Lenovo has many backup options available for your computer. Rewritable optical\ndrives are available for most machines and are easily installed.\n\u2022 Schedule system restore operations to take a system snapshot periodically. For more information about\nsystem restore, see Chapter 9 \u201cRecovery overview\u201d on page 111.\n\u2022 Update device drivers and UEFI BIOS when needed.\n\u2022 Profile your machine at http://www.lenovo.com/support to keep up to date with current drivers and\nrevisions.\n\u2022 Keep up to date for device drivers on other non-Lenovo hardware. You might want to read the device\ndriver information release notes prior to updating for compatibility or known issues.\n\u2022 Keep a log book. Entries might include major hardware or software changes, driver updates, minor issues\nyou have experienced, and how you resolved the minor issues.\n\u2022 If you ever need to run a recovery on your computer to return the preinstalled contents onto the machine,\nthe following tips might help along the way:\n\u2013 Remove all external devices such as the printer, keyboard, and so on.\n\u2013 Make sure that your battery is charged and your computer has the ac power connected.\n\u00a9 Copyright Lenovo 2013, 2015\n87\n", "Section Title: Making sure device drivers are up-to-date\n\n\u2013 Access ThinkPad Setup and load the default settings.\n\u2013 Restart the computer and start the recovery operation.\n\u2013 If your computer uses discs as the recovery media, do not remove the disc from the drive until\nprompted to do so.\n\u2022 For suspected hard disk drive issues, refer to \u201cDiagnosing problems\u201d on page 93 and run a diagnostic\ntest for the drive before you call the Customer Support Center. If your computer does not start up,\ndownload the files to create a bootable self-test medium from http://www.lenovo.com/hddtest. Run the\ntest and record any messages or error codes.

When calling the Customer Support Center, make\nsure that you have your machine model type, serial number, and the computer in front of you. Also, if the\ncomputer is producing error codes, it is helpful to have the error screen on or the messages written down.\nMaking sure device drivers are up-to-date\nDevice drivers are programs that contain instructions for the operating system about how to operate or\n\u201cdrive\u201d a certain piece of hardware. Each hardware component on your computer has its own specific driver.\nIf you add a new component, the operating system needs to be instructed on how to operate that piece\nof hardware. After you install the driver, the operating system can recognize the hardware component\nand understand how to use it.\nNote: Because drivers are programs, like any other file on your computer, they are susceptible to corruption\nand might not perform correctly if corruption occurs.\nIt is not always necessary to download the latest drivers. However, you should download the latest driver\nfor a component if you notice poor performance from that component or if you added a new component.\nThis might eliminate the driver as the potential cause of a problem.\nGetting the latest drivers from the Web site\nYou can download and install updated device drivers from the Lenovo Web site by doing the following:\n1. Go to http://www.lenovo.com/ThinkPadDrivers.\n2. Select the entry for your computer and then follow the instructions on the screen to download and\ninstall necessary software.\nGetting the latest drivers using System Update\nThe System Update program helps you keep the software on your computer up-to-date. Update packages\nare stored on Lenovo servers and can be downloaded from the Lenovo Support Web site. Update packages\ncan contain applications, device drivers, UEFI BIOS flashes, or software updates. When the System Update\nprogram connects to the Lenovo Support Web site, the System Update program automatically recognizes\nthe machine type and model of your computer, the installed operating system, and the language of the\noperating system to determine what updates are available for your computer. The System Update program\nthen displays a list of update packages and categorizes each update as critical, recommended, or optional to\nhelp you understand the importance. You have complete control of which updates to download and install.\nAfter you select the update packages you want, the System Update program automatically downloads and\ninstalls the updates without any further intervention from you.\nThe System Update program is preinstalled on your computer and is ready to run. The only prerequisite is\nan active Internet connection. You can start the program manually, or you can use the schedule feature\nto enable the program to search for updates automatically at specified intervals. You also can predefine\n88\nUser Guide\n", "Section Title: Taking care of your computer\n\nscheduled updates to search by severity (critical updates, critical and recommended updates, or all updates)\nso the list you choose from contains only those update types that are of interest to you.\nFor more information about how to use the System Update program, refer to the help information system\nof the program.\nTaking care of your computer\nAlthough your computer is designed to function reliably in normal work environments, you need to use\ncommon sense in handling it. By following the important tips in this topic, you will get the most use and\nenjoyment out of your computer.\nBe careful about where and how you work\n\u2022 Store packing materials safely out of the reach of children to prevent the risk of suffocation from plastic\nbags.\n\u2022 Keep your computer away from magnets, activated cellular phones, electrical appliances, or speakers\n(more than 13 cm or 5 inches).\n\u2022 Avoid subjecting your computer to extreme temperatures (below 5\u00b0C/41\u00b0F or above 35\u00b0C/95\u00b0F).\n\u2022 Some appliances, such as certain portable desktop fans or air purifiers, can produce negative ions. If a\ncomputer is close to such an appliance, and is exposed for an extended time to air containing negative\nions, it might become electrostatically charged. Such a charge might be discharged through your hands\nwhen you touch the keyboard or other parts of the computer, or through connectors on I/O devices\nconnected to the computer. Even though this kind of electrostatic discharge (ESD) is the opposite of a\ndischarge from your body or clothing to the computer, it poses the same risk of a computer malfunction.\nYour computer is designed and manufactured to minimize any effects of electrostatic charge. An electrostatic\ncharge above a certain limit, however, can increase the risk of ESD. Therefore, when using the computer\nclose to an appliance that can produce negative ions, give special attention to the following:\n\u2022 Avoid directly exposing your computer to the air from an appliance that can produce negative ions.\n\u2022 Keep your computer and peripherals as far as possible from such an appliance.\n\u2022 Wherever possible, ground your computer to facilitate safe electrostatic discharge.\nNote: Not all such appliances cause a significant electrostatic charge.\nBe gentle with your computer\n\u2022 Avoid placing any objects (including paper) between the display and the keyboard or the palm rest.\n\u2022 Your computer lid is designed to be opened and used at an angle slightly greater than 90 degrees. Do not\nopen the display beyond 180 degrees, as this might damage the computer hinge.\n\u2022 Do not turn your computer over while the ac power adapter is plugged in. This could break the adapter\nplug.\nCarry your computer properly\n\u2022 Before moving your computer, be sure to remove any media, turn off attached devices, and disconnect\ncords and cables.\n\u2022 When picking up your open computer, hold it by the bottom. Do not pick up or hold your computer by\nthe display.\nHandle storage media and drives properly\n\u2022 If your computer comes with an optical drive, do not touch the surface of a disc or the lens on the tray.\n\u2022 Wait until you hear the CD or DVD click into the center pivot of the drive before closing the tray.\nChapter 7.
